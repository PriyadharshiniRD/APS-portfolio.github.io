### Introduction

E-commerce, or electronic commerce, is the buying and selling of goods and services over the internet. It encompasses a wide range of online business activities for products and services, both retail and wholesale. E-commerce platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, and Meesho have revolutionized the way businesses operate and consumers shop, making transactions more efficient and accessible. These platforms provide a virtual marketplace where businesses can reach a global audience, and consumers can explore and purchase products from the comfort of their homes.
In this portfolio, we will delve into the various functionalities of e-commerce platforms from a DSA perspective, exploring how specific algorithms and data structures are employed to address key tasks and challenges. This exploration will not only highlight the importance of DSA in building robust e-commerce systems but also provide insights into the design and implementation of these critical components.

Logistics, being the heart of e-commerce, utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to optimize delivery routes, ensuring efficient and timely shipment of goods. By calculating the shortest paths in transportation networks, it minimizes costs and maximizes delivery speed, enhancing customer satisfaction and operational efficiency in e-commerce logistics.

#### Impact and Efficiency:
Using Dijkstra's Algorithm in logistics for e-commerce optimizes delivery routes, reducing transportation costs and time. It ensures efficient order fulfillment, enhances customer satisfaction with timely deliveries, and scales with increasing demand, making logistics operations more streamlined and cost-effective.


|Aspect           | Complexity      | 
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Time Complexity | O((V + E) log V)| 
| Space Complexity| O(V)            |
