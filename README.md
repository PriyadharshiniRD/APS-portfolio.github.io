### Introduction

E-commerce, or electronic commerce, is the buying and selling of goods and services over the internet. It encompasses a wide range of online business activities for products and services, both retail and wholesale. E-commerce platforms like Amazon, eBay, and Alibaba have revolutionized the way businesses operate and consumers shop, making transactions more efficient and accessible. These platforms provide a virtual marketplace where businesses can reach a global audience, and consumers can explore and purchase products from the comfort of their homes.
In this portfolio, we will delve into the various functionalities of e-commerce platforms from a DSA perspective, exploring how specific algorithms and data structures are employed to address key tasks and challenges. This exploration will not only highlight the importance of DSA in building robust e-commerce systems but also provide insights into the design and implementation of these critical components.
