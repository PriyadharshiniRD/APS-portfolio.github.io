### Introduction

E-commerce, or electronic commerce, is the buying and selling of goods and services over the internet. It encompasses a wide range of online business activities for products and services, both retail and wholesale. E-commerce platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, and Meesho have revolutionized the way businesses operate and consumers shop, making transactions more efficient and accessible. These platforms provide a virtual marketplace where businesses can reach a global audience, and consumers can explore and purchase products from the comfort of their homes.
In this portfolio, we will delve into the various functionalities of e-commerce platforms from a DSA perspective, exploring how specific algorithms and data structures are employed to address key tasks and challenges. This exploration will not only highlight the importance of DSA in building robust e-commerce systems but also provide insights into the design and implementation of these critical components.

### Why E-commerce

E-commerce has fundamentally transformed the global market, bringing numerous benefits and opportunities for both businesses and consumers. Here are some key ways in which e-commerce has revolutionized the way we buy and sell:
* Providing a wider reach for businesses to connect with a larger customer base.
* Offering convenience and ease of access for consumers to shop from anywhere at any time.
* Enabling businesses to operate with lower overhead costs compared to traditional brick-and-mortar stores.
* Facilitating a competitive market environment, encouraging better prices and services for consumers.
* Streamlining operations with advanced technologies such as data analytics, automated systems, and secure payment gateways.

### Objectives

* To explore the application of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in solving common tasks in e-commerce platforms.
* To analyze how specific algorithms and data structures optimize various functionalities like product search, recommendation systems and more.
* To provide a detailed design for each functionality, showcasing the use of appropriate data structures and algorithms.
* To increase your audience reach, DSA intelligently targets users based on their search intent, leveraging your product data
